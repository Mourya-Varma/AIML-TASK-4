Feature engineering is the essential process of transforming raw data into a format that machine learning algorithms can interpret effectively, bridging the gap between raw information and model requirements . Since most algorithms require numerical input, categorical data must be converted using specific techniques chosen based on the nature of the data . Label Encoding is applied to ordinal variables where a clear hierarchy exists, assigning unique integers to categories to preserve their logical order . Conversely, One-Hot Encoding is utilized for nominal data that lacks inherent order, creating binary columns for each category to prevent the model from inferring false mathematical relationships or hierarchies .

Once the data is encoded, feature scaling becomes critical, particularly for numerical attributes . This is required because many algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), rely on distance calculations to make predictions; if features exist on vastly different scales, those with larger magnitude ranges will disproportionately bias the results . To address this, Standardization (often using StandardScaler) adjusts the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, whereas Normalization rescales the data into a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1 . This comprehensive process ensures that the dataset is fully prepared and optimized for machine learning models .
